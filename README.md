# Slint Spatial Navigation Prototype

This is the prototype library for spatial navigation in Slint UI.
It provides the `SpatialFocusHandler` component
that can be used as root window element to catch spatial navigation events.

It is also required to initialize callbacks of the `SpatialFocus` global object.
For details see the [focus traverse example](examples/traverse.rs).
